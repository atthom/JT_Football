## Description

Little project in Web Semantic. Using a XML description of the cours in Polytech'Nice-Sophia, we are able to generate the individuals of our ontology.

## Getting Started ;)

1. Create your Ontology with Protege
2. Save your Ontology as Turtule Syntax
3. Launch xml2ttl.py, the file 'data.rdf' is created
4. Add the content of the file at the end of your .owl file.
5. Reload the ontology in Protege.
6. Voila !
